# 🐦 Boids Algorithm Visualizer

**Live Demo** → [boids-simulation.netlify.app](https://boids-simulation.netlify.app/)

A real-time boid flocking simulation built with **TypeScript**, the **HTML Canvas API**, and modern **CSS**.

## Features

### Adjustable Boid Behavior Parameters

Fine-tune the flocking dynamics with interactive sliders:

* **Cohesion** – steering toward nearby boid flockmates
* **Separation** – avoiding crowding and collisions
* **Alignment** – syncing direction to average direction of velocity of neighbors
* **Vision Radius** – the perception range for detecting nearby boids
And a few more.

### Visual Trails (Optional)

Toggle smooth trailing effects to visualize each boid’s path over time.
